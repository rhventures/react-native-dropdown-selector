# Development Guide

## Environment Setup

Follow the `Installing dependencies` section at [React Native: Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment).


## Clone the Repository

There are 2 ways to do this, **SSH** or **HTTPS**.

### SSH:
Use this command in terminals like Git Bash, Ubuntu, Powershell, etc.
```
git clone git@github.com:rhventures/react-native-dropdown-selector.git
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
If the above doesn't work, try the following instead:
```
git clone https://github.com/rhventures/react-native-dropdown-selector.git

### HTTPS:
Use this link in IDEs like VSCode, IntelliJ, etc. to clone directly.
```

npm install
```

Install the example dependencies in the `./example` directory.
```
cd example

## Run the Example Project

Run the following command while inside the `./example` directory. If using an emulator, make sure that your emulator from Android Studio is already running.
```
npm run android
