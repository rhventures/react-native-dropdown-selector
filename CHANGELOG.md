- Width of the dropdown lists becomes equal with the selector box by default, rather than expanding as wide as the screen width regardless of the selector box width ([#20](https://github.com/rhventures/react-native-dropdown-selector/pull/20)).
- Setting a custom `width` style for `listStyle` now works as intended ([#20](https://github.com/rhventures/react-native-dropdown-selector/pull/20)).
- Setting `center` for a custom `alignSelf` style for `listStyle` will now center it correctly ([#20](https://github.com/rhventures/react-native-dropdown-selector/pull/20)).
